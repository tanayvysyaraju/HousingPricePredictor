## Overview

This project implements a machine-learning–inspired house-price predictor in **C**.
Using fundamental **linear algebra**—matrix multiplication, transposition, and Gauss-Jordan elimination—the program learns a weight vector that models housing prices via linear regression.
It demonstrates how core supervised-learning ideas translate into low-level systems programming.

## Machine-Learning Foundation

For each house with attributes **x₁ … xₖ**, price **y** is modeled as

```
y = w₀ + w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + … + wₖxₖ
```

Weights **W** are solved analytically by the normal equation

```
W = (XᵀX)⁻¹ XᵀY
```

Predictions for new data **X′** follow:

```
Y′ = X′W
```

## Features

* Pure ANSI C (C99) implementation
* Hand-written matrix operations:

  * **transpose**
  * **multiply**
  * **invert** via simplified Gauss-Jordan
* Robust file I/O and dynamic memory management
* Outputs prices rounded to the nearest dollar
* Build-clean `Makefile` with strict warnings and sanitizers

## File Formats

### Training file (`train.txt`)

```
train
k            # number of attributes
n            # number of training houses
x₁ … xₖ y    # n lines of data
```

### Input file (`data.txt`)

```
data
k            # number of attributes
m            # number of houses to predict
x₁ … xₖ      # m lines of data
```

---

## Build & Run

```bash
cd src
make                # compile
./estimate train.txt data.txt
```

Example output:

```
737861
203060
```

(one predicted price per input line)

## Technical Highlights

* All calculations use `double` precision
* Gauss-Jordan elimination follows a fixed, swap-free schedule for stability
* Compiles with:
  `-Wall -Werror -std=c99 -fsanitize=address,undefined`

## Skills Demonstrated

* Practical use of **linear algebra** in C
* Insight into the mechanics of linear-regression machine learning
* Advanced memory-safe systems programming and Unix toolchain fluency
